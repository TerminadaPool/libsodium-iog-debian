# Build IOG specified version of libsodium as a deb package
This document outlines _one_ way to build the IOG specified version of libsodium (needed for compiling the cardano-node software) into a Debian package.  Building this library into a deb package makes it easier to install on any Debian or Ubuntu system and have the package management system take care of everything.

This is not an official deb package and it does not do things the official Debian/Ubuntu way.  Furthermore, this deb package does not deliver the proper copyright documents or any manuals.

This deb package will install the software in the following standard locations:

* Libraries get placed in /usr/lib/

## Setup your build environment
I usually create a virtual machine for building software and do everything on it.  This allows me to keep everything separated from my desktop PC.

I also create a separate user ('builder') for building.  This is advisable, even if you choose to build on your desktop PC, so that the installation of any local compilers, or any specific configurations, won't interfere with anything in your normal user account.
```
sudo adduser --gecos '' --disabled-password builder
```

Install build dependencies and some extra requirements
```
sudo apt install build-essential fakeroot devscripts debhelper autoconf-archive d-shlibs pkg-kde-tools git curl automake pkg-config libffi-dev libgmp-dev libssl-dev libtinfo-dev libsystemd-dev zlib1g-dev make jq libncursesw5 libtool autoconf libncurses-dev libncurses5
```

Recommend install llvm and set cc and c++ to use clang
```
sudo apt install llvm clang libnuma-dev; \
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/cc cc /usr/bin/clang 100; \
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/c++ c++ /usr/bin/clang++ 100
```

Switch to your builder account
```
sudo su - builder
```

The rest of this document assumes you are using your 'builder' account:  
builder@build:~$

The following sequence of commands will remove and recreate the "${HOME}/src/libsodium-iog" directory.  Familiarise yourself with the following commands before running them.  You can simply copy and paste the entire list of commands below into a bash terminal to run them in sequence.
```
# IOG specified SODIUM_COMMIT depends on CARDANO_NODE_VERSION
CARDANO_NODE_VERSION='8.9.1'; \
IOHKNIX_COMMIT="$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/$CARDANO_NODE_VERSION/flake.lock | jq -r '.nodes.iohkNix.locked.rev')"; \
echo "iohk-nix commit: $IOHKNIX_COMMIT"; \
SODIUM_COMMIT="$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/iohk-nix/$IOHKNIX_COMMIT/flake.lock | jq -r '.nodes.sodium.original.rev')"; \
echo "Using sodium commit: $SODIUM_COMMIT"; \

# Use same numeric libsodium version number as Debian stable
version='1.0.18'; \
package='libsodium-iog'; \
basedir="${HOME}/src/${package}"; \

mkdir -p "${basedir}"; \
cd "${basedir}"; \
rm -rf "${package}-${version}"; \

git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/libsodium "${package}-${version}"; \
cd "${package}-${version}"; \
git checkout "${SODIUM_COMMIT}"; \
git clone "https://github.com/TerminadaPool/libsodium-iog-debian.git" debian; \
unset CARDANO_NODE_VERSION IOHKNIX_COMMIT SODIUM_COMMIT version package basedir; \
debuild -us -uc -b;
```

Your debs will be produced in the parent directory: "${HOME}/src/libsodium-iog/".  They will be named something like:  
* libsodium-dev-iog_1.0.18_amd64.deb
* libsodium23-iog_1.0.18_amd64.deb

Put these files in your own local debian repository and install them on every machine required using apt.

## Notes
* libsodium-dev-iog package is configured to conflict with the standard Debian/Ubuntu libsodium-dev package.
* Similarly, libsodium23-iog is configured to conflict with the standard libsodium23 package.
* Thus installing libsodium-dev-iog and/or libsodium23-iog will cause the corresponding standard package to be removed.

See: 'control' file for where this is configured.
